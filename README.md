## 🔥 Why We Built This

It all started a few days ago when we uploaded an encrypted file to Gmail — and immediately got hit with a big red warning. Gmail clearly didn't like it. That got us thinking: Why such hostility to encryption? Maybe it's because they use our emails and documents to train AI models, or share data with surveillance alliances like the Five Eyes.

And if you try to host your own email server? Good luck. Most VPS providers block the necessary ports by default, and even if you get one running, major players like iCloud will silently block your messages. It's starting to feel like 1984, just with better UX.

So we built a tiny workaround: a simple tool to encrypt your emails before sending. Sure, you still have to call your friends and tell them the password. Yes, even your clipboard might betray you. But it's a small, meaningful step to take back some privacy in a world that resents it.

# 🛡️ The Ultimate Safety Guide: Maximum Security Communication

## 🎯 A Simple but Powerful System for Private Communication

In an era where digital privacy faces constant threats, this guide presents a practical method to protect your conversations—simple enough to use anywhere, yet secure enough to evade sophisticated surveillance.

## 📚 Method 1: The Shared Book Protocol

### Step 1: Establish Your Shared Key Source

**Choose a Standardized Text Source:**
- **Primary**: Use the Adobe PDF version: https://www.adobe.com/be_en/active-use/pdf/Alice_in_Wonderland.pdf
- **Backup**: Project Gutenberg's Alice in Wonderland (text version for verification)
- **Physical**: Dover Thrift Edition ISBN: 0-486-27543-4 (widely available, consistent pagination)
- **CRITICAL**: Both parties must use the exact same source to avoid synchronization failures

**Daily Password Generation:**
1. **Date-Based Page Selection**: Use the current date to select your page
   - Example: July 28th → Page 28
   - For dates beyond book length: Use modulo (e.g., Day 365 → Page 365 mod 200 = Page 165)

2. **Word Extraction**: Take the next three unused English words from that page
   - The text on Page 28:
        again !” For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making
quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
So she called softly after it: “Mouse dear!
Do come back again, and we won’t talk about
cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them !”
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round
and swam slowly back to her : its face was
quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and
it said in a low, trembling voice, “Let us get
to the shore, and then I ’ll tell you my history,
and you ’ll understand why it is I hate cats
and dogs.”
It was high time to go, for the pool was
getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there was a Duck
and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several
other curious creatures. Alice led the way,
and the whole party swam to the shore. 

https://www.adobe.com/be_en/active-use/pdf/Alice_in_Wonderland.pdf


   **Extraction Rules:**
   - **Start Position**: First complete word after any previous markings
   - **Word Definition**: English words only (ignore standalone punctuation: !", :, etc.)
   - **Capitalization**: Preserve exactly as written in source
   - **Example**: `again` + `For` + `the` → Combined: `againForthe` (no spaces, no punctuation)
   
   **Critical Marking System:**
   - Mark extracted words: `~~again~~ !" ~~For~~ ~~the~~ Mouse was swimming...`
   - Next usage of page 28: Start from `Mouse` → Extract `Mouse`, `was`, `swimming`

3. **Personal Salt Addition**: Append your shared secret number/phrase
   - Final password: `Again!Forthe888` (where 888 is your pre-agreed secret)

4. **Word Tracking**: Mark used words with a pen to ensure synchronization
   - Next occurrence of day 28: Use next three words (`Mouse`, `was`, `swimming`)

**Security Benefits:**
- ✅ Completely offline key generation
- ✅ Automatically rotating passwords
- ✅ Perfect synchronization between parties
- ✅ No digital footprint for password creation

### Step 2: Air-Gapped Decryption Setup

**Prepare Your Secure Environment:**

1. **Dedicated Offline Computer**
   - Use an old laptop or desktop computer
   - Install Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, or similar)
   - **CRITICAL**: Never connect to internet—physically remove WiFi card if necessary
   - Install T-Rex Text Encryptor or build from source

2. **Secure Message Transfer Process**
   ```
   Online Device → USB Drive → Offline Computer → USB Drive → Online Device
   ```

3. **Operational Workflow**
   - **Receiving**: Copy encrypted message from email/chat to USB
   - **Processing**: Transfer USB to offline machine, decrypt with daily password
   - **Responding**: Type reply on offline machine, encrypt with same password
   - **Sending**: Transfer encrypted response via USB back to online device

**Advanced Security Considerations:**
- Use encrypted USB drives for additional protection
- Regularly wipe USB drive metadata
- Consider multiple USB drives in rotation
- Store offline computer in a Faraday cage when not in use

## 📱 Method 2: Modern Convenience Adaptations

### OCR Integration (2024+ Smartphones)
Instead of USB transfers, leverage built-in OCR technology:

1. **Display encrypted text** on offline computer screen
2. **Photograph the text** using smartphone camera
3. **Extract text automatically** using phone's OCR capabilities
4. **Copy and send** directly from phone

**Benefits:**
- No physical USB transfer required
- Faster workflow for frequent communication
- Maintains air-gap security

### QR Code Alternative
For longer messages:
1. Generate QR codes on offline computer
2. Scan with smartphone camera
3. Automatically extract encrypted text

## 🔒 Professional Security Protocols

### Initial Setup Security
- **Meet in person** to establish the system (never digitally)
- **Verify identical sources** by comparing specific page excerpts
- **Establish backup communication method** (different book/system)
- **Create emergency abort signals** (specific phrases that mean "system compromised")
- **Set verification schedule** (monthly sync checks using predetermined page numbers)

### Advanced Synchronization Verification
**Daily Verification Protocol:**
1. **Test Message**: Send encrypted "SYNC-CHECK-[DATE]" using daily password
2. **Response**: Partner replies with "CONFIRMED-[DATE]" 
3. **Mismatch Response**: If verification fails, switch to backup book immediately

**Emergency Protocols:**
- **Lost Book Signal**: Send message "ALICE-MISSING" in plaintext
- **Compromised System**: Send "WONDERLAND-BURNED" to abort permanently  
- **Backup Activation**: Switch to pre-agreed backup book (e.g., Sherlock Holmes)

### Communication Security
- **Never discuss the book or method** over digital channels
- **Use innocent cover stories** ("book club", "literature project")
- **Vary message timing** to avoid creating patterns
- **Rotate books periodically** (every 6-12 months or after 1000+ uses)

### Operational Security (OPSEC)
- **Vary your communication patterns** to avoid creating identifiable signatures
- **Don't encrypt every message**—use for sensitive content only
- **Mix with normal communications** to avoid suspicion
- **Have plausible explanations** for encrypted messages if questioned

### Physical Security
- **Secure book storage**: Keep books in different physical locations
- **Offline computer isolation**: Store in secure, private location
- **USB drive protection**: Use encrypted drives with strong passwords
- **Disposal procedures**: Securely wipe all devices when retiring the system

- ❌ Physical device compromise (keyloggers, cameras)
- ❌ Targeted surveillance with unlimited resources
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Compromised book sources
- ❌ Human error in protocol execution

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Both parties must follow the protocol exactly** (zero tolerance for improvisation)
2. **Offline computer must never connect to internet** (physical WiFi removal recommended)
3. **Book synchronization must be maintained** (monthly verification mandatory)
4. **Personal secrets must remain truly secret** (memorize, never write down)
5. **Backup systems must be in place** (secondary book, emergency protocols)
6. **Regular security audits** (monthly review of all physical components)

### Professional Risk Mitigation
**Single Points of Failure:**
- **Book Loss**: Maintain backup book system (different title, same protocol)
- **Computer Compromise**: Use dedicated, never-online computer only
- **USB Compromise**: Use multiple USBs in rotation, encrypt with strong passwords
- **Personal Secret Compromise**: Change secret monthly, verify partner knows new one
- **Synchronization Failure**: Implement verification protocol and backup books

**Forensic Resistance Measures:**
- **Memory Cleaning**: Securely wipe all USB drives after each use
- **Computer Storage**: Use full-disk encryption on offline computer
- **Physical Evidence**: Store books in separate, innocuous locations
- **Digital Traces**: Never store passwords or encrypted text on online devices
- **Communication Metadata**: Vary message lengths, timing, and delivery methods

## 🌟 Philosophy: Stay Small, Stay Local, Stay Ahead

This system embodies a fundamental principle: **true privacy comes from simplicity and independence**.

**Core Values:**
- **Decentralization**: No reliance on corporate infrastructure
- **Transparency**: Open-source tools and verifiable methods  
- **Resilience**: Works without internet or modern technology
- **Accessibility**: Uses common items (books, old computers)
- **Sustainability**: Long-term viable without ongoing costs

**The Meta-Security Advantage:**
The greatest security comes not just from strong encryption, but from using methods that surveillance systems aren't designed to detect or counter. A physical book and an air-gapped computer represent "analog security" in a digital surveillance age.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Professional Implementation Checklist:

**Phase 1: Secure Setup (Week 1)**
- [ ] **Meet in person** to verify identical Alice in Wonderland sources
- [ ] **Verify page 28 text** matches exactly (compare first 3 lines character-by-character)
- [ ] **Establish shared secret** (memorize 3-4 digit number, never write down)
- [ ] **Select backup book** (e.g., Sherlock Holmes: A Study in Scarlet)
- [ ] **Create emergency signals** ("ALICE-MISSING", "WONDERLAND-BURNED")

**Phase 2: Technical Implementation (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] **Prepare offline computer** (old laptop, Linux install, WiFi card removed)
- [ ] **Install T-Rex Text Encryptor** (build from source, verify checksums)
- [ ] **Set up encrypted USBs** (minimum 3 drives, strong passwords, rotate usage)
- [ ] **Test password generation** (verify first 5 days match between partners)
- [ ] **Practice full workflow** (encrypt/decrypt test messages)

**Phase 3: Operational Security (Week 2-3)**
- [ ] **Implement verification protocol** (daily SYNC-CHECK messages)
- [ ] **Establish communication schedule** (avoid patterns, vary timing)
- [ ] **Test emergency procedures** (practice backup book activation)
- [ ] **Security audit** (review all physical security measures)
- [ ] **Go live** with real sensitive communications

**Monthly Maintenance:**
- [ ] **Verify synchronization** (compare next 10 passwords from current date)
- [ ] **Security review** (check all physical components, storage locations)
- [ ] **Rotate USBs** (securely wipe and replace older drives)
- [ ] **Update personal secrets** (if desired, coordinate with partner)

### Gradual Adoption Strategy:
1. **Week 1**: Set up the system and practice with test messages
2. **Week 2**: Use for non-critical but private communications
3. **Week 3+**: Gradually increase usage for sensitive topics
4. **Monthly**: Review and refine your operational security
