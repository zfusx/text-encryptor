## 🦕 T-Rex Text Encryptor - Initial Release

### Why We Built This
It all started when we uploaded an encrypted file to Gmail and got hit with a big red warning. Gmail clearly didn't like it. This tool is our small rebellion against surveillance capitalism.

### Downloads
- **Windows**: `text-encryptor-windows.exe`
- **macOS**: `text-encryptor-macos.app` 
- **Linux**: Build from source (instructions in README)

### Features
- 🛡️ Military-Grade Encryption (Argon2id + ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- 🌙 Beautiful Tokyo Night Theme
- 📋 One-Click Copy to Clipboard
- 🔑 Flexible Key Management
- 🚀 Lightning Fast Native Performance

### First Run Instructions
- **Windows**: Windows Defender might warn - click "Run anyway"
- **macOS**: Right-click → "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper
- **Linux**: `chmod +x text-encryptor-linux && ./text-encryptor-linux`

**🦕 Built with prehistoric power and modern cryptography!**
```

7. **Upload your binaries**:
   - Drag `releases/text-encryptor-windows.exe`
   - Drag `releases/text-encryptor-macos.app` (zip it first: `cd releases && zip -r text-encryptor-macos.zip text-encryptor-macos.app`)

8. **Click "Publish release"**

## 🤖 Step 4: Enable Automated Builds (Optional)

Your GitHub Actions workflow is ready! For future releases:

1. **Tag a new version**:
```bash
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build for Windows, macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), and Linux
   - Create a new release
   - Upload all binaries

## 📣 Step 5: Share Your Project

### Update README Links
In your README.md, replace the download links:
- Change `[Releases](../../releases)` to your actual GitHub releases page
- Add your GitHub username to clone instructions

### Share It!
- **Twitter/X**: "🦕 Just released T-Rex Text Encryptor - military-grade encryption for everyone! No more Gmail warnings when sharing encrypted files. #Privacy #Encryption #OpenSource"
- **Reddit**: r/privacy, r/encryption, r/golang, r/opensource
- **Hacker News**: Submit with title "T-Rex Text Encryptor – Fighting surveillance capitalism one encrypted message at a time"
